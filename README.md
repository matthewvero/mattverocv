My personal website!

Environment: 
- Javascript
- ReactJS (Hooks)
- SCSS
- Styled-Components
- HTML
- CSSTransition 

This is a simple SPA that uses my favourite technologies to tell you a bit about me. It's a work in progress and I'm excited to improve it as I learn more about design going forward. 

I enjoyed designing and building the project card components, this was a fun exercise in condensing information in to a small form factor, which is also responsive to page sizing without sacrificing any information as the screen decreases in size. I'm excited to add more of these to the site as I create more projects. 

(Feel free to suggest how I can improve this)
